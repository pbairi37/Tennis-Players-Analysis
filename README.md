# Tennis-Players-Analysis

This tutorial will go through the data life cycle of data collection, data processing, exploratory analysis and visualization, hypothesis testing and machine learning, and conclusions with this research question in mind.

As someone who has been playing Tennis her whole life, I was interested in observing and analyzing what attributes are common between the best tennis players. The research question here is “What makes a tennis player the best?”
